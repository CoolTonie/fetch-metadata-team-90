Made Research and provided a solution on how we can extract text from images using pytessarct, a python machine learning library that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and works based on Tesseract, a software that helps in the extraction of text from images.
Was able to extract metadata from some files such as: images, pdfs file, mp3 and mp4 files using some python libraries such as pillow, pikepdf and pymediainfo. I was also able to implement the extraction of metadata in Django, using Django signals.

I also implemented the finished design from the Frontend codes of our home page into Django templates. https://github.com/Kingsley-Opara/fetch-metadata-team-90/blob/main/templates/index.html
